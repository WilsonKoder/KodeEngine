{"name":"KodeEngine","tagline":"A Cross Platform Game Engine.","body":"### KodeEngine Development State.\r\n\r\nKodeEngine is in very, very early stages of development, with no implementation of a Physics or Audio API *yet*. The rendering API is still being actively developed, with ease of use a key goal in the development of our API's. KodeEngine will eventually be a full game engine, but for now it is closer to a wrapper of OpenGL functions.\r\n\r\n### Want to Help?\r\n\r\nIf you want to help in the development of this project, please email me at `wilson.koder.111@gmail.com`, if you wan't you can show me some of your previous projects. If you just want to browse the source and take a look, email me and I'll see.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
